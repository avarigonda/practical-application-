Since car column has no importance in terms of whether the coupon will be accepted or not it doesn't matter if it has null values values. However if we dropped the car column it will erase a lot of data so the best thing to do with the car column is leave it. This follow non null values for the car column, (Scooter and motorcycle', 'crossover', 'Mazda5', 'do not drive', 'Car that is too old to install Onstar :D') does not have any importance with accepting the coupons and since there are overwelming more null value than all non null values combined for the car column it is best to leave as it is. The other ones were dropped because they had a small amount of missing values so the mode of frequent values can fill in

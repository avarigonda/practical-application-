# Handling the missing values
Since the car column is irrelevant to whether the coupon will be accepted, it doesn't matter if it has null values. However, dropping the car column would erase a lot of data, so the best thing to do with the car column is to leave it. This follow non null values for the car column, (Scooter and motorcycle', 'crossover', 'Mazda5', 'do not drive', 'Car that is too old to install Onstar :D') does not have any importance with accepting the coupons. Since there are overwhelming more null values than all non-null values combined for the car column, it is best to leave it as it is. For Bars, Coffee Houses, Carry out and Takeaway, Restaurants less than 20, and Restaurants 20 to 50, those were filled in with the highest frequency of the nonnull values since the missing values in those categories are small and they are essential for the question, will the customer accept the coupon?

# Bar Coupon
Based on the observations and analysis of the bar coupons data, we can make the following hypotheses about drivers who accepted the bar coupons: For Frequency of Bar Visit, drivers who go to bars more frequently more than once a month tend to have a higher acceptance rate for bar coupons, which suggests that individuals who already have a habit of visiting bars are more likely to accept such coupons.
In terms of the Age Factor, younger drivers under the age of 30 show a higher acceptance rate for bar coupons, which shows that the age demographic plays a role in the likelihood of accepting bar-related offers.
For Passenger and Marital Status, the drivers who go to bars more than once a month and have passengers who are not kids and are not widowed show a higher acceptance rate. This indicates that social factors, such as having a partner or friends as passengers, impact the acceptance of bar coupons.
For Occupation Influence, drivers who go to bars more than once a month, have passengers who are not kids and have occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry show a higher acceptance rate. This shows that certain occupations may be more receptive to bar-related promotions.
Income and Restaurant Visits, which refers to drivers who go to cheap restaurants more than four times a month and have an income less than $50K, resulted in a NaN (Not a Number) acceptance rate, which means there are no acceptance or non-acceptance data for that category since there are probably null values in there.
Overall, bar coupon acceptance is based on age, frequency of bar visits, passengers and marital status, occupation, and potential income. It shows how certain drivers are impacted by bar acceptance.
